% STATEMACHINEBALANCING computes robot state and references of the walking
%                     with MPC demo.
%
% USAGE: please note that this function has been designed for being inserted 
%        in a Simulink model.
%
% FORMAT:  [state, references_CoM, references_LFoot, references_RFoot, references_rot_task, feetInContact, references_s] = stateMachineBalancing ...
%              (s_0, w_H_rot_task_0, w_H_CoM_0, w_H_LFoot_0, w_H_RFoot_0, b_H_LFoot, b_H_RFoot, LFoot_wrench, RFoot_wrench, Config, Sat)
%
% INPUT:  - s_0 = [ROBOT_DOF * 1] initial joints positions
%         - b_H_LFoot = [4 * 4] base to LFoot transform
%         - b_H_RFoot = [4 * 4] base to RFoot transform
%         - w_H_rot_task_0 = [4 * 4] world to rot task transform in the initial configuration
%         - w_H_CoM_0 = [4 * 4] world to CoM transform in the initial configuration
%         - w_H_LFoot_0 = [4 * 4] world to LFoot transform in the initial configuration
%         - w_H_RFoot_0 = [4 * 4] world to RFoot transform in the initial configuration
%         - LFoot_wrench = [6 * 1] external forces and moments acting on the left foot
%         - RFoot_wrench = [6 * 1] external forces and moments acting on the right foot
%         - Config = user defined configuration
%         - Sat = a structure containing user defined saturation parameters
%
% OUTPUT: - state = current state of state machine
%         - references_CoM = [3 * 3] desired CoM position, velocity and acceleration
%         - references_LFoot = [6 * 5] desired LFoot pose, velocity
%                              and acceleration. NOTE that the format
%                              is: [pos, linear_vel, linear_acc, zeros(3,2);
%                                   Rotation, angular_vel, angular_acc] 
%         - references_RFoot = [6 * 5] desired RFoot pose, velocity and acceleration
%         - references_rot_task = [3 * 5] desired rotational task link orientation, angular velocity and acceleration.
%                                 NOTE that the format is: [Rotation, angular_vel, angular_acc]     
%         - feetInContact = [2 * 1] feet in contact
%         - references_s = [ROBOT_DOF * 3] desired joint positions, velocities and accelerations
