## Module description

This module implements a position control balancing strategy. It computes the joint positions (control input) taking directly the desired joint references or starting from a cartesian task reference. Then, the joints positions are computed through inverse kinematics. The inverse kinematics is subject to a set of equality and inequality contraints, and it is solved by means of a Quadratic Programming solver.

### Compatibility

The repository contains the Simulink model `taskBasedBalancing.mdl`, which is generated by using Matlab R2016b.

### Supported robots

Currently, supported robots are: `icubGazeboSim`.

## Module details

### Configuration file

At start, the module calls the initialization file `initTaskBasedBalancing.m`. Once opened, this file contains some configuration variables. Please follow the instruction inside this script to properly configure your simulation.

### Robot and demo specific configurations

The gains and references for a specific robot (specified by the variable `YARP_ROBOT_NAME`) or a specific demo can be found in the folder `app/robots/YARP_ROBOT_NAME`.
