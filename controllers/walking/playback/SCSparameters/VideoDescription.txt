The video shows the iCub walking using an Instantaneous Capture Point based walking algorithm (IHMC algorithm). 
Given a set of desired footsteps it is possible to generate a desired trajectory for the ICP, subsequently a QP momentum based controller computes the necessary torques to move the ICP along the desired trajectory and achieve task space foot trajectories.
